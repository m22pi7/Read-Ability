Hello Judges! I hope this github finds you in good health. Thank you so much for hosting this hackathon our group had a lot of fun. The problem we adressed was that we love our grandparents, but they don't always understand us. To grow closer to them, we decided to make this program that would help them understand what we send by translating our acronyms. We created a website where your grandparents can submit your texts and emails. The website will read through the submission and replace acronyms with their definitions to make it easier for them to understand. It will then return the text in its newly legible form. We created an html5 webpage where users could submit their files. Javascript submits the text to a python program that scans through the text for any acronyms or slang on our database (which has almost 6000 entries). The text is replaced with its definition, and is then handed back to the html5 page, which displays the translated text.
